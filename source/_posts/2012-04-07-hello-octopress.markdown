Hi there!

This my first post using [Octopress](http://octopress.org). Today I setup
[this blog](http://blog.ccare.me) which is currently hosted on
[github pages](http://pages.github.com/).
Since I tend to write most of my fragmented thoughts when offline, I'm
hoping that having the content in a git repo (that's editable offline) will be a
great help. I also like the fact that I'll be able to be more in control of my
content (when compared to the hosted accounts I've used before).

So, fingers-crossed, and here we go! I plan to migrate older posts from other
sources to here during the next few weeks)
