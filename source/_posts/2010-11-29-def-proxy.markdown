A while ago, I wrote some funky code to proxy interfaces method calls
and delegate against a meta Object. For the last couple of day Tim Watson
and I have been generalising this as a library for custom proxying between
Java interfaces.

Code's available on github: https://github.com/hyperthunk/def-proxy
