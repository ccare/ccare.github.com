It's nice to see Ways of Thinking, Ways of Seeing (ed. Bissell & Dillon) finally published [1]. I contributed Chapter 5 (see [2]), entitled 'Early Computational Modelling: Physical Models, Electrical Analogies and Analogue Computers'. The origins of this book came from a session which Chris Bissell organised at SHOT 2007. It's taken a while to find it's way into print, but I think it's an interesting collection of different perspectives on modelling.

Thanks to Chris Bissell and Chris Dillon for making it all happen!
