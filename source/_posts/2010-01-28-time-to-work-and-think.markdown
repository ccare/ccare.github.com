These days it's very rare for me to have time to dedicate to writing and research. Today, however, I am on leave from my 'day job' and am working at Warwick (where I'm a visiting fellow). I don't know what it is about the Arts Centre Cafe, but I'd forgotten how productive I find it as an environment. I've just spent the last hour working on a particularly difficult chapter and got quite a bit done. I've also had an interesting conversation with another researcher who was just 'passing through'. All in all - It was definitely worth the 90 minute drive to get here.
