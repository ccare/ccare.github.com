Today's my last full-day working at BT. I'm marking the event with a final
visit to Adastral Park in Martlesham, Ipswich.

Over the last few years, I've worked with some pretty smart engineers
and had a lot of fun. I'm really excited about joining [Talis](http://talis.com), but
I'm going to miss a lot of great people.
