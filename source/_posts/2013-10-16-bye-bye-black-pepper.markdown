Anyone watching my [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/charlescare) and 
[Github](https://github.com/ccare) profiles over the last couple of weeks will 
have noticed that I'm about to embark on a new challenge. I've decided
to move on from [Black Pepper Software](http://www.blackpepper.co.uk) and 
join the expanding [team](http://company.meducation.net) building [Meducation](https://www.meducation.net).

Meducation are a really exciting Birmingham based start-up. They provide a social network 
targeted at medics that has a strong educational focus.
 Founded a few years ago, they have been steadily growing, and have
just raised funding to expand and accelerate.
I'm going to be joining a fantastic team who are passionate about developing a
successful business with a [great set of values](http://company.meducation.net/jobs/principles). 

Despite 
all the excitement, moving on is not without a bit of sadness. Black Pepper 
is a fantastic company with a fantastic culture and jam-packed with highly intelligent 
people. I will miss them, and wish them every success in their future work.
