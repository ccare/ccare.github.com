Over the last few months I've been trying to understand a little more about semantic web concepts etc... Here's a list of some of the books I've been flicking through. Thought I'd blog them so I can find them again in the future.

John Davies, Rudi Studer, Paul Warren. Semantic web technologies: trends and research in ontology-based systems. Wiley 2006.



Karin K. Breitman, Marco Antonio Casanova, Walter Truszkowski. Semantic web: concepts, technologies, and applications.Springer 2006.

Dean Allemang, Jim Hendler, Semantic web for the working ontologist: Effective modelling in RDFS and OWL.Elsevier 2008..



  

Pascal Hitzler, Markus Krotzsch, Sebastian Rudolph. Foundations of semantic web technologies. CRC Press, 2010



I found Davies et al. (2006) Quite interesting to flick through... two of the authors worked at the same company I was with so there's some interesting case studies. However, I found the focus was a bit too much towards reasoning, discovery and other conceptual ideas.

Breitman et al. (2006) and Allemang et al. (2008) were interesting as well

My favourite was Hitzler et al. (2010). I really enjoyed their coverage of sparql - I read this one far more closely than the others.
