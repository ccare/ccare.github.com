Today bought a new EeePC (I broke my old and trust 901 model... ).

It came with Windows (of course). I was going to blat the whole disk with
ubuntu, but decided to keep a dual boot for now.

Ubuntu 10.04 is out next month, so I went straight for the Beta release.
Installation went fine (as usual). Only immediate problem was a lack of
wireless LAN. After digging around some forum posts I found this
helpful [thread](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9033458).


To install the drivers for the wireless network card I downloaded the following package.

Simple :)
