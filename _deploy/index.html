  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, when I got home, the first thing greeting me was the box containing my
new Galago Pro. Very exciting. I&rsquo;ve just started at
<a href="http://company.meducation.net">Meducation</a> so I needed to get a new development machine.
The Galago is from <a href="http://system76.com/">System 76</a>, a Linux-only laptop
supplier that ship machines pre-configured with Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Actually, I was a bit apprehensive about the purchase. In terms of spec,
and money, the machine is awesome. However, the keyboard has attracted a
significant amount of criticism on Internet forums (see <a href="http://blag.depotwarehouse.net/2013/09/system76-galago-ultrapro-galu1-review.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.goodstuff.im/sorry_system76">here</a>). I didn&rsquo;t know if I would
find the keyboard annoying or whether it would be fine. I&rsquo;m not a particularly
demanding user, I spend the majority of my time in the console and I don&rsquo;t have a
particular need for typing at a high RPM. In fact, this blog post is the
longest continuous bit of typing I&rsquo;ve had to do this week.</p>

<p>So, the keyboard? Well it&rsquo;s not too bad.
It&rsquo;s got chicklet style keys, and probably doesn&rsquo;t have an experience anything
like a MacBook Pro (which, incidently I also find I
miss keys on). At first, it seemed that certain key strokes didn&rsquo;t register. For
me, the key missses tended to be alpha keys near the edge of the keyboard (A, S, M etc).
I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything technicaly wrong with the keyboard, it&rsquo;s
probably because my fingers strike
those keys with less force. To be honest, I tend to struggle with most new keyboards I try,
it&rsquo;s one of the things I find difficult about frequent pair rotation.
In fact, when I think about my old favorite machines, they all had sigificant burn
in. I still harken after my old Sony Vaio, I wrote my PhD thesis on that, and I
adore my little Asus netbook with it&rsquo;s diddy Atom processor and I wrote my book on
that. However, with no immediate writing projects on the horizon, the Galago keyboard
will not have to endure all that hammering. Maybe I should blog more? If
I can get through this post
without falling out of love with the laptop, then I&rsquo;ll probably be ok going
forward.</p>

<p>Right. So that&rsquo;s the keyboard issue discussed &ndash; with a final judgement due later.
Now to describe the rest of the machine. The Galago is, I think, the best looking
laptop I&rsquo;ve ever bought. It&rsquo;s sleek and solid, and even with the extra hard
disk I fitted, it&rsquo;s pretty light. The screen has full HD resolution and is
bright and sharp. The rear cooling grills also seem to work very well &ndash; no overheating so far.
 One or two reviews I read before buying the device expressed concern that the rather
narrow hinge between the screen and the keyboard was rather narrow, it doesn&rsquo;t
feel overly fragile, but I am pretty rough with my kit so time will tell there
too.</p>

<p>Initially I thought that buying a System76 was a bit gimmicky. The machine
itself is actually manufactured in France, and I&rsquo;m in the UK, so I could have
got the same box from a European supplier. Even with shipping, System76 was actually
marginally cheaper, but I have to admit that deep down I wanted that Ubuntu key.
Yeh I know, it seems petty, but I&rsquo;ve been using Ubuntu for about 7 years, and
before that I was a RedHat and
Solaris guy. So it&rsquo;s been 13 years since I last used Windows as my main system and
that makes me wondern why I must have that Windows key? Stickers are all well and good,
but finally I have the proper solution.</p>

<p><img src="/images/galago-ubuntu-key.jpg" title="The Galago, like other System 76 laptops features a Ubuntu key" ></p>

<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s amazing is the way the hardware just works. I powered on
(very quickly, thanks to the SSD) and went straight into the final
configuration screens of the Ubuntu setup process. No need to download and
configure an ISO &ndash; the System76 guys had sorted it. For the first time ever, I
was able to go from unwrapping a UPS parcel to typing in a shell within minutes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also fantastic that I can use and rely on all those &lsquo;function&rsquo; keys that
I&rsquo;m usually scared of. During installation I playfully hit func+F4 thinking &lsquo;I
wonder what this key with the Moon symbol does&rsquo;. Immediately, the laptop
suspended to disk and switched off. I confess that I was mildly concerned, thinking I&rsquo;d suspended
mid installation and would be forced to rebuild from scratch. Far from the disaster I anticipated, the
laptop resumed in exactly the same state. I know it&rsquo;s probably not that awesome
to all you Mac and Windows users, but I&rsquo;m sold.</p>

<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a fab machine, that I think I&rsquo;ll enjoy using. And the
keyboard? Well, since I haven&rsquo;t missed any keys in the last few paragraphs. I think
we&rsquo;ll get along just fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone watching my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/charlescare">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ccare">Github</a> profiles over the last couple of weeks will
have noticed that I&rsquo;m about to embark on a new challenge. I&rsquo;ve decided
to move on from <a href="http://www.blackpepper.co.uk">Black Pepper Software</a> and
join the expanding <a href="http://company.meducation.net">team</a> building <a href="https://www.meducation.net">Meducation</a>.</p>

<p>Meducation are a really exciting Birmingham based start-up. They provide a social network
targeted at medics that has a strong educational focus.
 Founded a few years ago, they have been steadily growing, and have
just raised funding to expand and accelerate.
I&rsquo;m going to be joining a fantastic team who are passionate about developing a
successful business with a <a href="http://company.meducation.net/jobs/principles">great set of values</a>.</p>

<p>Despite
all the excitement, moving on is not without a bit of sadness. Black Pepper
is a fantastic company with a fantastic culture and jam-packed with highly intelligent
people. I will miss them, and wish them every success in their future work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On a number of occassions over the last year or so, I&rsquo;ve found myself writing
wanting to create a reverse proxy to front a number of HTTP services. For me,
the usual requirement is that I want to access these services via AJAX requests,
and using a reverse proxy allows me to not need to worry about cross-site scripting
(XSS) or configuring cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). Node.js is a fantastic
tool for doing this. Particularly if you lean on the well-regarded
node-http-proxy module.</p>

<p>If all you need is static proxying/routing, then node-http-proxy project
supports a variety of
<a href="configuration%20options">https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy</a>.
However, I usually find myself turning to this library when I want to
do custom routing. So in this post, I focus on configuring the proxy with
custom code.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll share some code snippets to create a simple reverse proxy
in Node.js and then move onto a slightly more complicated example with some routing
and express middleware. Finally, I&rsquo;ll show how to base the routing on an asynchronous
call to another service (e.g. a service-discovery service for looking up endpoints ).</p>

<p>It is very common requirement for software systems to generate a PDF document of some kind. For instance, at
<a href="http://www.blackpepper.co.uk">Black Pepper</a>, we&rsquo;ve built a number of e-commerce systems, and usually our clients have a requirement to produce a nicely formatted invoice or contract which their customers can access through the web.</p>

<p>We often work on a Java stack, and there are therefore a number of approaches to generating a PDF, including Apache FOP (based on XSL), iText, and a variety of others [1]. In a number of solutions we&rsquo;ve gone down the iText approach since it&rsquo;s pure Java and therefore reasonably straight forward to integrate and test. However, it presents a DOM-based approach which is not without it shortcomings. A better solution is to use a template so that layout can be separated from the PDF generation. That&rsquo;s precisely what we wanted to do for a recent project, when we discovered the XDocReport library [2] which provided exactly what we needed. This post describes how to get started with that library.</p>

<p>A few months back I had to debug an Adobe Flex application that used Adobe Message Format (AMF) for client-server communication. For readers unfamiliar with Adobe&rsquo;s Flex/Flash stack, AMF is a binary RPC communication protocol, usually powered by Adobe&rsquo;s BlazeDS technology. The application I was working on used BlazeDS to expose a number of AMF web services, backed by a fairly standard Java/Spring/Hibernate stack.</p>

<p>As I started investigating the bug, I quickly began to suspect that the root cause was data related. Since many of the application screens were data-driven, I conjectured that there was inconsistent or incomplete data being returned from the web services. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t have access to a stable version of Adobe FlexBuilder for Linux, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to easily jump in and attach a debugger to the Flex application. However, I was able to read the code and understand a bit about the RPC service calls it was making. The server-side access logs also provided a good idea of the client-server interactions that were happening. In order to gain further insight into the scenario under test, I found myself wanting to &lsquo;see&rsquo; the data that was flowing between the two applications.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of years, it has become increasingly common for web applications to be built using client-side frameworks that interact with a remote server via asynchronous requests. Unlike a traditional app, that makes a single request per page, a modern web application will probably make many asynchronous HTTP requests. This poses a challenge when analysing server logs, since it can be difficult to identify which requests belong to the same client.</p>

<p>In this blog post I&rsquo;ll describe a simple technique we&rsquo;ve applied to retro-fit a client-aware correlation token to the server logs of an existing web application.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The shortcomings of Java&rsquo;s native date and time support is well known. Asking a developer about a date/time problem in Java is a good way of judging their exposure to building systems with it. For new projects, Joda time is excellent, but there&rsquo;s plenty of native code out there that uses the standard Java APIs. Today I ran into an interesting and unexpected behaviour relating to Timestamps.</p>
