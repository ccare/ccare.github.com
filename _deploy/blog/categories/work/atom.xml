    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anyone watching my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/charlescare">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ccare">Github</a> profiles over the last couple of weeks will
have noticed that I&rsquo;m about to embark on a new challenge. I&rsquo;ve decided
to move on from <a href="http://www.blackpepper.co.uk">Black Pepper Software</a> and
join the expanding <a href="http://company.meducation.net">team</a> building <a href="https://www.meducation.net">Meducation</a>.</p>

<p>Meducation are a really exciting Birmingham based start-up. They provide a social network
targeted at medics that has a strong educational focus.
 Founded a few years ago, they have been steadily growing, and have
just raised funding to expand and accelerate.
I&rsquo;m going to be joining a fantastic team who are passionate about developing a
successful business with a <a href="http://company.meducation.net/jobs/principles">great set of values</a>.</p>

<p>Despite
all the excitement, moving on is not without a bit of sadness. Black Pepper
is a fantastic company with a fantastic culture and jam-packed with highly intelligent
people. I will miss them, and wish them every success in their future work.</p>
