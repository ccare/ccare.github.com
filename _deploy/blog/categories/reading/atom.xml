    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve been trying to understand a little more about semantic web concepts etc&hellip; Here&rsquo;s a list of some of the books I&rsquo;ve been flicking through. Thought I&rsquo;d blog them so I can find them again in the future.</p>

<p>John Davies, Rudi Studer, Paul Warren. Semantic web technologies: trends and research in ontology-based systems. Wiley 2006.</p>

<p>Karin K. Breitman, Marco Antonio Casanova, Walter Truszkowski. Semantic web: concepts, technologies, and applications.Springer 2006.</p>

<p>Dean Allemang, Jim Hendler, Semantic web for the working ontologist: Effective modelling in RDFS and OWL.Elsevier 2008..</p>

<p>Pascal Hitzler, Markus Krotzsch, Sebastian Rudolph. Foundations of semantic web technologies. CRC Press, 2010</p>

<p>I found Davies et al. (2006) Quite interesting to flick through&hellip; two of the authors worked at the same company I was with so there&rsquo;s some interesting case studies. However, I found the focus was a bit too much towards reasoning, discovery and other conceptual ideas.</p>

<p>Breitman et al. (2006) and Allemang et al. (2008) were interesting as well</p>

<p>My favourite was Hitzler et al. (2010). I really enjoyed their coverage of sparql &ndash; I read this one far more closely than the others.</p>
